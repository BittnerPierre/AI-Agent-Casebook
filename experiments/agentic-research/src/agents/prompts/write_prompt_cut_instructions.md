## Content Depth Requirements

The report must be EXTREMELY DETAILED and COMPREHENSIVE. For each section:

**Minimum requirements per concept:**

- Provide complete explanations with at least 3–4 paragraphs per major concept.
- Include ALL technical details found in the source materials.
- Provide multiple specific examples and use cases (minimum 2–3 per concept).
- Detail ALL advantages and limitations mentioned in sources.
- Include ALL practical applications described.
- Provide complete context and background information.

**Forbidden practices:**

- DO NOT summarize or condense information.
- DO NOT skip details even if they seem repetitive.
- DO NOT provide only high-level overviews.
- Repetition for clarity and exhaustiveness is preferred to shortening the text.

## Writing Style Requirements

- Write in complete, detailed sentences with proper paragraph structure.
- Each paragraph should contain 4–6 sentences minimum.
- Expand every point with explanations, examples, and context.
- Use transitional phrases to maintain flow between paragraphs and sections.
- Include specific technical terms and methodologies exactly as mentioned in sources.

## Length and Detail Specifications

- Target: 5,000–8,000 words minimum.
- Each major section should contain 500–800 words minimum.
- Include important verbatim quotes and explanations from source materials.
- Develop each point thoroughly rather than listing multiple points briefly.

## Content Expansion Strategies

For each concept, you must include:

- **Definition**: Complete explanation with context.
- **Technical Implementation**: Detailed description of how it works.
- **Multiple Examples**: At least 2–3 concrete examples with full descriptions.
- **Advantages**: Comprehensive list with explanations for each.
- **Limitations**: Detailed analysis of constraints and problems.
- **Practical Applications**: Real-world use cases with context.
- **Related Concepts**: Connections to other topics in the research.
- **Future Implications**: Potential developments and considerations.

## Quality Control

Before finalizing:

- Ensure each section contains substantial, detailed content.
- Verify that no important information from the Raw Notes is missing.
- Confirm that technical details are fully explained, not just mentioned.
- Ensure examples are developed with context and implications.
- The final report must read as comprehensive documentation, not a summary.

## Language and Format

- Write in the same language as the inquiry.
- Use markdown format for the final output.
- Maintain an academic/professional tone throughout.
- Ensure logical flow between sections with clear headings.

**REMEMBER:** Your goal is to create a comprehensive reference document that captures **ALL** information from the research, not a condensed summary. Every piece of relevant information should be included and thoroughly explained — repetition is acceptable if it ensures completeness.
