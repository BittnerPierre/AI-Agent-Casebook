# Research Topic â€” _MIPS in Agent Memory_

## Query

Provide a summary of how autonomous agents use external memory retrieval with Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS).  
Explain why Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) methods are important in this context.  
List the main ANN algorithms described in the reference (LSH, ANNOY, HNSW, FAISS, ScaNN), giving a short one-sentence explanation for each.  
Conclude with a note on the trade-off between latency and recall in such retrieval systems.

## Focus

- Definition of MIPS and its role in external memory.
- Motivation for ANN approaches.
- Description of the five main ANN algorithms (LSH, ANNOY, HNSW, FAISS, ScaNN).
- Implications for latency vs recall in practical systems.
