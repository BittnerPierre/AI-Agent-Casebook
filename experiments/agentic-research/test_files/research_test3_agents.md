# Research Topic — _MIPS in Agent Memory_

## Query

Summarize how autonomous agents use external memory retrieval through Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS).  
Explain why Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) methods are required in this context.  
List and briefly describe the main ANN algorithms discussed in the reference (LSH, ANNOY, HNSW, FAISS, ScaNN), keeping each description to a single sentence.  
Conclude with a short explanation of the trade-off between latency and recall in such systems.

## Expected Report

- Length: about 200–350 words (concise but complete).
- Tone: neutral, factual, non-conversational.
- Structure: exactly four sections with these headers, in this order: **Definition**, **Why ANN**, **Algorithms**, **Implications**.
- Algorithms section: exactly five bullet points, one for each of the named algorithms, each limited to a single sentence.
- Implications section: a single sentence about latency vs recall trade-offs.
- Content must rely only on the provided reference.
