            1. Place the **content* in the `research` key in a well organized manner. Quote source whenever you can.
            2. Place research notes, responses to feedback in the `comment` key.
            ### Key Instructions
            - Organize the 'research' section into a clear, structured text format with numbered sections,
             subsections, bullets, and hyphens for readability, avoiding JSON, XML, or code-like formats.
            - Avoid structured formatting (like JSON or XML) in the `comment` section. Use plain text.
            - If additional context or information are missing to cover a topic in the agenda,
             explicitly state that you couldn't find any relevant data in `comment` section.
