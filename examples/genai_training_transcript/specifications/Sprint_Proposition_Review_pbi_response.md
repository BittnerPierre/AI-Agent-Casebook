# Sprint Proposition Review: Agentic Content Production

## Executive Summary

The sprint proposition presents an ambitious evolution from our current training transcript generator toward a comprehensive "Agentic Content Production" system. This review analyzes the proposal against our existing architecture, Issue 28 vision, and PR 33 implementation focus.

## Strengths of the Proposition

### 1. **Strategic Vision Alignment**

- ✅ Aligns with Issue 28's vision of adaptive agentic workflows
- ✅ Addresses "Narrative Fidelity at Scale" challenge effectively
- ✅ Clear progression from assistants → prompt engineering → agentic systems

### 2. **Comprehensive Workflow Design**

- ✅ Well-structured 7-step agent workflow (Idea Generation → Production Preparation)
- ✅ Proper feedback loops between Research ↔ Scriptwriting and Creative Director
- ✅ Clear role definitions for specialized agents

### 3. **Multi-Format Scope**

- ✅ Covers diverse content types: YouTube, training courses, podcasts, documentaries
- ✅ Addresses both short-form and long-form content needs

## Critical Questions & Concerns

### 1. **Architecture Integration**

**Question**: How does this proposal integrate with our existing 3-module architecture?

- Current: Knowledge Manager, Content Creation, Feedback/Evaluation
- Proposed: Seems to focus primarily on Content Creation module
- **Need**: Clear mapping between current modules and new agent roles

[pbi]: this is a first draft for discussion to align and evolve the current implementation to the long term vision. First, I wanted to contextualize our work within current technology landscape in AI and give context on the business stakes for content creation as it was not the primary focus during our previous discussion but it should (always) be. The document should answers a lot of questions that was raiseregarding measurement and evaluation. We aim to create an agentic system for « content creation » and stakes are not the same as for agentics system for coding for example.

1. The First solution we have made in examples is a training course generator with a static workflow. It is very early stage in its development. But as discussed we are aiming for a more dynamic and general purpose. It is made with Agents SDK. The first iteration (sprint) of this agentic workflow for content creation was on the editing workflow. The knowledge management and feedback/evaluation module was less developed for the first one and inexistant for the second . So the relation (interaction) between module (design pattern) needs to be discussed but we still keep a kiss / tag I approach of iterative software development.
   [pbi] also It as never been stated that our architecture will solely based on 3 modules. This will evolve any time it make sense. For example, we have a module for storage (MCP Evernote) and the UI module is missing. We are agile and so should be the architecture which should capture the flow of evolution with best practices for applications design pattern.
   [pbi]: also as team showed good technical skill and cooperation, I m positioning myself as product owner giving epic, business requirements and user story level direction (hopefully acceptance criteria). I also act as global architect giving directive of technical choice based on our conversation. So we can, consider this exchange as a PO / Scrum Master conversation pre sprint planning in order to me to groom the back log and define properly User Story for next sprint. I hope sufficient functional and technical details in order to the team to make good work.
   [pbi]: Important: In the doc, I didn’t give agent (meaning AI agent) role but I’ve detailed role in a « real life » content production team. There is no (and should not) 1-to-1 mapping between them. As we are aiming for dynamic, self optimizing team, the number of AI agent and their responsibilities could evolve in order to reach the most efficient organisation. We should start small with minimum role and agent (kiss). The role does not cover knowledge management (aka veille and curation) and access. Or evaluation and optimization but they are key as the workflow should be self optimising based on user feedback and usage). So no it s not Content Creation module focused, it is because we now more on that. Look at work on video_script in ../../app directory for langgraph implantation on video transcript. We have made more work for research and editing.

**Concern**: The proposition doesn't address how this integrates with:

- Our existing MCP filesystem protocol usage
- Training Manager's preprocessed transcript workflow
- Knowledge Database Interface (from PR 33)

[pbi] and why I should address this integration ? MCP can be define at Agent level with Agents SDK. No discussion for MCP filesystem. We can discuss the function of the Knowledge Management module and so the API (or function) it will expose through MCP protocol.
[pbi] Knowledge database will be access for lookup (give me content that match this question, or meta database: list me the content that is indexed or tagged with this keyword).
[pbi] I will provide you the flow of data between each module starting from a user request to the final result.

### 2. **Technical Implementation Gaps**

**Question**: What's the relationship to our current Agents SDK implementation?

- Current system uses Agents SDK with specific tools (FileClient, TranscriptGenerator, etc.)
- Proposed system mentions "AI agents" but unclear if using same SDK
- **Need**: Technical specification for agent implementation framework

[pbi] I don’t understand why your are asking this question. When a module requires a IA agent workflow, it should use Agents SDK. This is written in the plan.md I think that we primarily use Agents SDK. But each module should communicate through a clear interface (MCP base).

**Missing**:

- How do the 7 proposed agents map to our current tools/agents?
- What happens to our current Research Team (Planner, Researcher) and Editing Team structure?

[pbi] Name and description should be clear enough in order for you to do the mapping, otherwise there is a problem in the code or spec.
[pbi] So to be clear:

- Idea Generation & Agenda Creation -> Planner
- Agenda Review & Feedback -> not present ATM
- Research & Fact-Gathering -> research team
- Drafting the Script
- Script Refinement
- Final Review
- Production Preparation

When I read the code of transcript_generator, a lot is not implemented and we are far away from a working pipeline. ./app/video_script is way more advanced and should be our inspiration.

### 3. **Scope and Timeline Concerns**

**Question**: Is this a single sprint or a multi-epic transformation?

- The scope appears much larger than a typical sprint
- Involves fundamental architecture changes
- **Concern**: Risk of scope creep from current focused training transcript work

[pbi] this is a multi epic discussion in order to identify the priority for next sprint.
[pbi] I agree on the risk by adopting to a dynamic planner and not a static graph as in video_script may avoid useless refactoring later.

**Current State Analysis**:

- PR 33 focuses on Knowledge Database + Training Manager enhancements
- This proposition seems to pivot toward general content creation
- **Need**: Clear phasing strategy

[pbi] Primary focus is 1) working editing pipeline (it s almost a Mock here). No renaming for generic purpose at this moment. 2) Working interface between Knowledge database and editing pipeline. Editing Pipeline should use Knowledge management module to access to knowledge. 3) first version of evaluation. This one should be passive (post model execution) or dynamic: controller agent, like reviewer, authoring agent, could push data (event) when something not could is proposer. We are looking for a system that look alike post-training (RLHF - SFT) module. The conversation could be used for model fine-tuning. What is important here is clear interface to operate between module Knowledge <-> [Research - Editing] <-> Evaluation and Optimization. Something we didn’t discuss yet but IS VERY IMPORTANT is the editing team should be fed with example of good script (good intro, good CTA, chapter introduction). This should work as few shot prompting. So we need a new module in which we could look up examples for style. This has not been identified until now but is very important. Research -> find the good content, Editing -> style, tone, structure, Evaluation & Optimisation -> been able to improve for long term in « real time » or learn for next run.

What come next (less priorities):

- RAG within Knowledge Module: simple lookup by keyword is good but a retrieval based on question (for example researcher agent has a question like ‘I am looking info on distractor during embedding lookup in vector database ».
- Externalise or dynamic planner (yaml file to parameterize de execution workflow
- Replan of the execution
- Human-in-the-loop (for example) reviewing of a chapter can be done or approved by a human
- Memory (short and long) for example feedback given by a user could be memorize and used for next chapter or run.
- UI: we should start with basic command line with argument but an interactive command line interface (with human in the loop as Claude code) then an on web UX (API)

## Detailed Technical Questions

### Knowledge Management Integration

1. **How does the "Research Assistant" integrate with our Knowledge Database Interface?**
   - Current: MCP-based access to preprocessed transcripts
   - Proposed: "detailed information, facts, and context"
   - Gap: No mention of our existing metadata indexing system

[pbi] Need to be discuss. IF you have proposition.

2. **What happens to our transcript preprocessing pipeline?**
   - Current: Raw .txt → cleaned .md → metadata index
   - Proposed: Seems to assume research content is readily available
   - Need: Clear integration path

[pbi] Research team produce a research note (.txt in a folder) that is then use by editing team. Knowledge module can give access to full file (no chunking for now as RAG came later).
[pbi] Editing Team take the research note and load it into openai platform and use Response API file_search for RAG during generation.

### Agent Architecture Questions

1. **Framework Selection**:
   - Continue with Agents SDK StateGraph?
   - Move to different framework?
   - How does this relate to Issue 28's mention of LangGraph vs StateGraph?

[pbi] There is no StateGraph in Agents SDK, I think it is State Management. Yes we stay with Agents SDK but each module should be able to use its own library that s why inter module communication is based on MCP.

2. **Agent Specialization**:
   - Current: 5 agents (Planner, Researcher, Documentalist, Writer, Reviewer)
   - Proposed: 7+ agents (Host, Producer, Research Assistant, Fact-Checker, etc.)
   - Question: Are these complementary or replacing existing agents?

[pbi] Again, there is no link between the functional role (real life) and agent define. Host & Producer are the « User ».

3. **Cost and Performance**:
   - Proposal mentions "cost-efficiency" but 7+ agents could increase costs
   - How do we maintain the "Late chunking" efficiency mentioned in Issue 28?

[pbi] again this is business role, not the agent we have to implement. Agent will be dynamically define (statically now) in the execution plan. We could pre define (developer prim agent that will be call when needed.

## Integration with Existing Specifications

### Alignment with Current Plan (plan.md)

**Positive Alignment**:

- ✅ Maintains focus on content creation workflows
- ✅ Supports multiple content formats
- ✅ Includes quality assurance processes

**Gaps**:

- ❌ No mention of MCP integration strategy
- ❌ Doesn't address existing FileClient/Evernote integration work
- ❌ Missing connection to our manifest.json metadata approach

### Relationship to PR 33 Work

**Current PR 33 Focus**:

- Knowledge Database Interface completion
- Training Manager production features
- MCP Knowledge Server implementation
- Cross-agent integration support

**Proposition Overlap**:

- Research Agent could use Knowledge Database Interface
- Content creation workflow could leverage Training Manager outputs
- But no explicit integration plan provided

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Phased Integration Approach

1. **Phase 1**: Complete PR 33 work (Knowledge + Training Manager)
2. **Phase 2**: Enhance existing Research/Editing teams with new agent roles
3. **Phase 3**: Expand to multi-format content generation
4. **Phase 4**: Add advanced feedback loops and optimization

### Option 2: Proof of Concept Approach

1. **Sprint 1**: Build small-scale prototype with 2-3 core agents
2. **Sprint 2**: Validate integration with existing Knowledge Database
3. **Sprint 3**: Expand agent team if prototype succeeds
4. **Sprint 4**: Scale to full vision

### Option 3: Parallel Development

- Continue PR 33 focus on infrastructure
- Start experimental branch for new agent architecture
- Merge approaches once both are validated

</No comment from PBI section>

## Specific Clarifications Needed

### 1. **Scope Definition**

- Is this replacing our current training transcript focus?
- Or expanding beyond training to general content creation?
- What's the priority: depth (better training transcripts) vs breadth (multiple formats)?

[pbi] Giving more context for expanding of a more general content creation pipeline
[pbi] Priority is a working training transcript with knowledge access and Evaluation.

### 2. **Technical Architecture**

- Detailed agent interaction diagram showing data flow
- Integration points with existing MCP filesystem approach
- Performance/cost analysis for 7+ agent system

[pbi] correct, should be done ASAP.

### 3. **Timeline and Phases**

- What can realistically be achieved in one sprint?
- What are the dependencies on PR 33 completion?
- How do we maintain momentum on current work while exploring new direction?

[pbi] This is the most important question: what should be done next to move forward quickly.

### 4. **Success Metrics**

- How do we measure "Narrative Fidelity at Scale"?
- What are the quality benchmarks for multi-format content?
- How do we validate the cost-efficiency claims?

[pbi] I should provide test case. For example syllabus and expected transcript.

## Conclusion

The proposition presents an exciting and ambitious vision that aligns well with our strategic direction from Issue 28. However, it needs significant clarification on technical implementation, integration with existing work, and realistic scoping for sprint execution.

I recommend we schedule a technical alignment session to address these questions before proceeding with implementation.

---

**Next Steps**:

1. Technical architecture session with all agents
2. Integration mapping workshop
3. Revised sprint plan with clearer phases
4. Prototype development with success metrics
