      "summary": "### Advanced Retrieval for AI with Chroma - Introduction\n\nThe course focuses on **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**, a method that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing context through document retrieval. While basic approaches use semantic similarity or embeddings, this course delves into advanced techniques like **query expansion**, which rewords user queries to find directly relevant documents. Key methods include expanding queries and hypothesizing answers to better capture relevant information.\n\nInstructor **Anton Troynikov** of Chroma will guide participants through improving RAG with methods such as use of an LLM for query refinement, re-ranking results via cross encoders, and altering query embeddings based on feedback. The course will conclude with cutting-edge RAG techniques just emerging in research.\n\nAcknowledgments are given to contributors from Chroma and Deep Learning teams. The first lesson available offers an overview, aiming to empower teams to achieve results previously unattainable.",
