I’m working on autonomous agents and I’d like a clear explanation of how they use external memory. Could you summarize the role of Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in that process, and then outline the main Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms that are commonly used (LSH, ANNOY, HNSW, FAISS, ScaNN)? Please keep it concise and neutral, with each algorithm explained in a single sentence. I’m particularly interested in how these methods impact latency and recall in practice
