# Codex Sprint 1 Review Response

## Executive Summary
- Overall readiness: Need Clarifications
- Timeline confidence: Medium
- Technical risk level: Medium

## User Story Review
### US-003: Research Team Knowledge Integration
- Status: Questions
- Comments: The interface signature in sprint_1.md specifies a class method `ResearchTeam.research_topic(syllabus_section)`, but the current stub in `research_team.py` uses `aggregate_research(agenda, transcripts, config)`. We need alignment on naming, input/output parameters, and a JSON schema for `research_notes.json`.
- Dependencies: US-003 must be resolved before US-004 can implement content synthesis.

### US-011: Response API File_Search Integration Pattern
- Status: Blocker
- Comments: The spec references `examples/response_api_file_search_example.py`, but this file is missing. We need a concrete example in the repo and guidance on project setup (`proj_UWuOPp9MOKrOCtZABSCTY4Um`) and configuration for file_search.
- Dependencies: US-011 must be available prior to beginning US-004.

### US-004: Response API Content Synthesis
- Status: Questions
- Comments: The multi-step synthesis (syllabus → agenda → research notes → chapter) is feasible, but the prompt templates, chunking strategy, and error handling for large inputs are not defined. We need sample prompt templates and guidance on partial/chunked processing.
- Dependencies: Relies on US-003 (research notes) and US-011 (file_search example).

### US-009: End-to-End CLI Integration
- Status: Green Light
- Comments: The CLI entrypoint `transcript-generator --syllabus <file>` is clear. Framework choice (click vs argparse) can be decided during implementation. Integration points are well defined.
- Dependencies: Depends on WorkflowOrchestrator (US-006) and all upstream modules, but content-generation-specific dependencies are satisfied once prior stories are resolved.

### US-010: Example Syllabus Validation
- Status: Green Light
- Comments: The integration test spec in `tests/integration_test.py` is clear. A sample syllabus file and test fixture will be needed, but overall acceptance criteria are well defined.
- Dependencies: End-to-end pipeline completion.

## Technical Architecture Review
- Agent SDK approach: Clear multi-agent coordination pattern in Inter_Module_Architecture.md; no further clarification needed.
- MCP integration: High-level MCP protocol usage is defined, but code examples for file operations and knowledge lookup need to be aligned with the stub interfaces.
- Data schemas: Simplified JSON schemas are mentioned, but explicit schema definitions for ResearchNotes and ChapterDraft are missing and should be added to Inter_Module_Architecture.md.
- Testing approach: Weekly integration milestones are feasible; tests will need sample data and fixtures to validate each stage.

## Sprint Execution Concerns
- US-003 and US-011 are blockers for downstream stories; they should be prioritized early in Week 1.
- The tight coupling between US-011 and US-004 may risk Week 2 delivery if the example is delayed.
- Coordination needed with Claude Code for alignment on JSON schema definitions and MCP server interfaces.

## Questions for Product Owner
- Should the research notes schema and chapter draft schema be formally defined in a JSON schema file?
- Where should the Response API file_search example reside, and what configuration should be used for the OpenAI project?
- Are there preferred prompt templates or guidelines for chapter synthesis to enforce consistency?

## Final Recommendation
Need sprint planning meeting to resolve interface alignment (US-003), example code availability (US-011), and data schema definitions before Sprint 1 can start.
