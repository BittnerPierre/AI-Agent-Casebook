Tests for Editorial Finalizer - US-005 Implementation

This module tests the EditorialFinalizer class to ensure it correctly:
1. Uses LLM-based semantic assessment for quality control
2. Implements sophisticated multi-agent quality review workflow
3. Performs semantic content-syllabus alignment verification
4. Conducts pedagogical quality assessment via AI agents
5. Produces correct output files (final_transcript.md, quality_issues.json)
6. Tracks quality metrics for evaluation system integration

NOTE: These tests verify the INTENDED sophisticated implementation,
not the current basic pattern matching approach which was identified
as inadequate in the gap analysis.
