Specification Tests for Multi-Agent EditorialFinalizer Implementation

This test file defines the INTENDED behavior for the sophisticated 
multi-agent EditorialFinalizer that should replace the current 
basic pattern matching implementation.

These tests document the requirements discovered in the gap analysis:
- LLM-based semantic content assessment
- Multi-agent quality review workflow 
- Semantic content-syllabus alignment verification
- Pedagogical quality assessment via AI agents
- Training course principles compliance checking

Current Status: SPECIFICATION TESTS - Will fail until proper implementation

            Welcome to neural networks! Let's build on your linear algebra knowledge.
            
            Think of a neural network like a team of specialists - each neuron examines
            specific patterns and shares insights with others.
            
            🤔 Question: How might this be similar to how your brain processes information?
            
            Let's start simple: A perceptron takes inputs, applies weights, and produces output.
            
            Try this: Calculate the output when inputs [1, 0] meet weights [0.5, -0.3] with bias 0.1
            
            Key insight: The magic happens when we chain these simple units together!
