# Prompt Engineering for Developers - Complete Training Module

## Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Welcome to this comprehensive module on prompt engineering for developers. In this session, we'll explore the fundamental techniques that transform how we interact with large language models to build robust, reliable AI applications.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing text inputs to elicit desired responses from language models. As developers, understanding these techniques is crucial for building production-ready AI systems that behave predictably and effectively.

## Understanding System vs User Prompts

### System Prompts: Setting the Foundation

System prompts establish the context and behavioral guidelines for your AI assistant. Think of them as configuration files for language model behavior.

**Example System Prompt:**
```
You are a helpful coding assistant specialized in Python development. You provide clear, well-commented code examples and explain complex concepts in simple terms. Always consider best practices for code safety and performance.
```

System prompts are particularly powerful because they:
- Set the overall tone and personality
- Define expertise areas and limitations
- Establish response format preferences
- Configure safety and ethical guidelines

### User Prompts: The Specific Request

User prompts contain the actual task or question. They should be clear, specific, and provide necessary context.

**Example User Prompt:**
```
Write a Python function that calculates the moving average of a list of numbers with a configurable window size. Include error handling for edge cases.
```

### Best Practices for Prompt Structure

1. **Be Specific**: Vague prompts lead to unpredictable outputs
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
3. **Set Expectations**: Specify desired format, length, or style
4. **Use Examples**: Show the model what good output looks like

## Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Techniques

### Zero-Shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompting relies on the model's pre-trained knowledge without providing examples. This technique works well for common tasks that the model has seen during training.

**Example Zero-Shot Prompt:**
```
Classify the sentiment of this customer review as positive, negative, or neutral:
"The product arrived quickly but the quality was disappointing."
```

Zero-shot prompting is ideal when:
- The task is straightforward and common
- You need quick results without setup
- The domain is well-represented in training data

### Few-Shot Prompting

Few-shot prompting provides examples to guide the model's understanding of the task format and requirements.

**Example Few-Shot Prompt:**
```
Classify customer feedback sentiment:

Example 1:
Feedback: "Excellent service, very satisfied!"
Sentiment: Positive

Example 2:
Feedback: "Delivery was late and item was damaged"
Sentiment: Negative

Example 3:
Feedback: "Product works as expected"
Sentiment: Neutral

Now classify:
Feedback: "Good quality but expensive for what it is"
Sentiment:
```

Few-shot prompting excels when:
- The task format needs clarification
- You need consistent output structure
- The domain requires specific expertise
- Edge cases need explicit handling

## Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting encourages the model to show its reasoning process step-by-step. This technique dramatically improves performance on complex reasoning tasks.

### Basic Chain-of-Thought

**Example:**
```
Question: A restaurant serves 150 customers on weekdays and 40% more on weekends. If they're open 6 days a week (5 weekdays, 1 weekend day), how many customers do they serve per week?

Let me think through this step by step:

1. Weekday customers: 150 per day
2. Weekend increase: 40% of 150 = 60 additional customers
3. Weekend customers: 150 + 60 = 210 per day
4. Weekly total: (5 × 150) + (1 × 210) = 750 + 210 = 960 customers
```

### Advanced CoT Techniques

**Self-Consistency**: Generate multiple reasoning paths and choose the most common answer.

**Tree of Thoughts**: Explore multiple reasoning branches simultaneously.

**Verification**: Ask the model to double-check its reasoning.

## ReAct Prompting (Reasoning + Acting)

ReAct combines reasoning with action execution, making it powerful for multi-step problem solving and tool usage.

### ReAct Pattern Structure

```
Thought: [Reasoning about what to do next]
Action: [Specific action to take]
Observation: [Result of the action]
Thought: [Reasoning about the observation]
Action: [Next action based on new information]
...
```

### ReAct Example: Web Research Task

```
Question: What's the current stock price of Apple and how has it changed this week?

Thought: I need to get the current stock price for Apple (AAPL) and compare it to prices from earlier this week.

Action: Search for "Apple AAPL current stock price"

Observation: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently trading at $185.42, up 2.3% from yesterday.

Thought: I have the current price, but I need historical data from this week to show the change.

Action: Search for "Apple AAPL stock price this week chart"

Observation: Weekly data shows: Monday $180.15, Tuesday $182.30, Wednesday $181.95, Thursday $183.67, Friday $185.42.

Thought: Now I can calculate the weekly change and provide a comprehensive answer.

Answer: Apple (AAPL) is currently trading at $185.42. This week, the stock has gained $5.27 or 2.93% from Monday's opening price of $180.15, showing positive momentum throughout the week.
```

## Hands-On: Iterative Prompt Optimization

### The Optimization Process

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with a basic prompt
2. **Test and Evaluate**: Run the prompt with various inputs
3. **Identify Issues**: Note inconsistencies, errors, or format problems
4. **Refine Systematically**: Make targeted improvements
5. **Validate**: Test the improved prompt thoroughly

### Practical Example: Code Documentation Generator

**Initial Prompt (v1):**
```
Write documentation for this function:
[CODE]
```

**Issues Found:**
- Inconsistent format
- Missing parameter descriptions
- No examples provided

**Improved Prompt (v2):**
```
Generate comprehensive documentation for the following Python function. Include:
- Brief description of purpose
- Parameter descriptions with types
- Return value description
- Usage example
- Any important notes or warnings

Function to document:
[CODE]
```

**Further Refinement (v3):**
```
You are a technical documentation specialist. Generate professional API documentation for the following Python function using this exact format:

## Function Name
Brief one-line description.

### Parameters
- `param_name` (type): Description of parameter and constraints
- `param_name` (type): Description of parameter and constraints

### Returns
`return_type`: Description of return value

### Example Usage
```python
# Provide a clear, working example
result = function_name(example_args)
print(result)  # Expected output
```

### Notes
- Any important implementation details
- Performance considerations
- Common pitfalls to avoid

Function to document:
[CODE]
```

## Advanced Prompt Engineering Patterns

### Template-Based Prompts

Create reusable prompt templates for consistent results:

```python
ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE = """
Analyze the following {data_type} for {analysis_goal}:

Data: {input_data}

Please provide:
1. Key findings (top 3-5 insights)
2. Patterns or trends observed
3. Recommendations based on analysis
4. Confidence level in findings (High/Medium/Low)

Format your response as a structured report.
"""
```

### Conditional Prompting

Adapt prompts based on input characteristics:

```python
def create_review_prompt(review_length):
    if review_length < 50:
        return "Provide a brief sentiment analysis for this short review:"
    elif review_length < 200:
        return "Analyze sentiment and key themes in this review:"
    else:
        return "Provide comprehensive sentiment analysis, key themes, and specific concerns from this detailed review:"
```

### Error Handling in Prompts

Build robustness into your prompts:

```
Analyze the customer feedback below. If the input is unclear, too short, or not actually customer feedback, respond with "INVALID_INPUT" and explain why.

For valid feedback, provide:
- Sentiment: [Positive/Negative/Neutral]
- Key themes: [List main topics]
- Priority level: [High/Medium/Low]

Customer feedback: {input_text}
```

## Production Considerations

### Prompt Security

- **Input Sanitization**: Validate and clean user inputs
- **Injection Prevention**: Guard against prompt injection attacks
- **Content Filtering**: Implement appropriate safety measures
- **Rate Limiting**: Control API usage and costs

### Performance Optimization

- **Prompt Length**: Balance specificity with token efficiency
- **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models for each task
- **Caching**: Store and reuse successful prompt patterns
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar requests efficiently

### Testing and Validation

- **Regression Testing**: Ensure prompt changes don't break existing functionality
- **A/B Testing**: Compare prompt variants systematically
- **Human Evaluation**: Get expert feedback on output quality
- **Automated Metrics**: Track success rates and consistency
