# Process Improvements: Preventing Architecture Violations

**Document ID**: PROC-001  
**Date**: 2025-06-23  
**Status**: PROPOSED  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Affects**: All development workflows  

## Executive Summary

This document outlines comprehensive process improvements to prevent architecture violations like the Assistant API vs Agents SDK issue. The recommendations establish multi-layered governance including automated enforcement, enhanced review processes, and cultural changes to prioritize architecture compliance.

## Current State Assessment

### Process Gaps Identified
1. **No Architecture Review**: Critical API decisions made without architectural oversight
2. **Insufficient Documentation**: CLAUDE.md lacked specific API governance rules
3. **Manual-Only Enforcement**: No automated compliance checking
4. **Limited Review Scope**: Code reviews focused on functionality, not architecture
5. **Knowledge Gaps**: Team unfamiliarity with approved vs prohibited APIs

### Impact of Current Gaps
- 2 PRs with architecture violations approved and merged
- ~1,000 lines of non-compliant code in production
- Mixed API usage patterns across codebase
- Undermined development standards credibility

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Automated Compliance Enforcement

#### 1.1 Pre-Commit Hooks
**Implementation**: Add to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: api-compliance-check
        name: API Compliance Check
        entry: scripts/check-api-compliance.sh
        language: script
        files: '\.py$'
        stages: [pre-commit]
```

**Script**: `scripts/check-api-compliance.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check for prohibited API usage

echo "🔍 Checking API compliance..."

# Check for Assistant API usage
if rg "client\.beta\.assistants" --type py .; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Assistant API usage prohibited"
    echo "   Use Agents SDK instead: agents.Agent, agents.Runner"
    exit 1
fi

# Check for Threads API usage
if rg "client\.beta\.threads" --type py .; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Threads API usage prohibited"
    echo "   Use Agents SDK workflow patterns instead"
    exit 1
fi

# Check for required imports when using file search
if rg "file_search" --type py . && ! rg "from agents import.*FileSearchTool" --type py .; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: File search must use FileSearchTool from Agents SDK"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ API compliance check passed"
```

#### 1.2 CI/CD Pipeline Checks
**GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/architecture-compliance.yml`
```yaml
name: Architecture Compliance

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**/*.py'
      - 'src/**'
      - 'tests/**'

jobs:
  api-compliance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Install ripgrep
        run: sudo apt-get install -y ripgrep
        
      - name: API Compliance Check
        run: |
          echo "🔍 Checking for prohibited API usage..."
          
          # Assistant API check
          if rg "client\.beta\.assistants" --type py .; then
            echo "::error::Assistant API usage prohibited. Use Agents SDK: agents.Agent"
            exit 1
          fi
          
          # Threads API check
          if rg "client\.beta\.threads" --type py .; then
            echo "::error::Threads API usage prohibited. Use Agents SDK patterns"
            exit 1
          fi
          
          # FileSearch compliance
          if rg "\"file_search\"" --type py . && ! rg "FileSearchTool" --type py .; then
            echo "::error::File search must use agents.FileSearchTool"
            exit 1
          fi
          
          echo "✅ Architecture compliance validated"
```

#### 1.3 IDE Integration
**VSCode Settings**: `.vscode/settings.json`
```json
{
  "python.linting.pylintArgs": [
    "--load-plugins=pylint_architecture_checker"
  ],
  "python.analysis.diagnostics": {
    "prohibited-apis": "error"
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Review Process

#### 2.1 Multi-Stage PR Review
**Required Reviewers**: Update `.github/CODEOWNERS`
```
# Architecture compliance required for core components

## Risk Mitigation

### Process Adoption Risks
- **Risk**: Team resistance to new processes
- **Mitigation**: Gradual rollout, training, and feedback incorporation
- **Monitoring**: Team satisfaction surveys and adoption metrics

### Tool Performance Risks
- **Risk**: Automated checks slowing development
- **Mitigation**: Performance optimization and selective checking
- **Monitoring**: CI/CD performance metrics and developer feedback

### Compliance Overhead Risks
- **Risk**: Process complexity reducing productivity
- **Mitigation**: Streamlined workflows and tool automation
