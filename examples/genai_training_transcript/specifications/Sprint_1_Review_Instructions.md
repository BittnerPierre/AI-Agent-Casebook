# Sprint 1 Review Instructions for Team

## üéØ Purpose
Before Sprint 1 execution begins, we need **final validation** from Codex and Cursor that all user stories, requirements, and technical specifications are clear and actionable. This is your opportunity to identify any blockers, unclear requirements, or missing information **before** development starts.

## üìã What We've Delivered for Review

### 1. **Complete User Stories (GitHub Issues #46-60)**
- **15 user stories** with acceptance criteria, technical implementation details, and dependencies
- **Clear developer assignments:** Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, All developers
- **Priority levels:** P0 (Week 1), P1 (Week 2), P2 (Week 3), P3 (Week 4)
- **Sprint planning cross-references** to original questions and discussions

### 2. **Comprehensive Architecture Documentation**
- **sprint_1.md:** Complete user stories with architecture decisions and testing milestones
- **C4_Architecture_Mermaid.md:** Visual architecture with detailed component descriptions
- **Inter_Module_Architecture.md:** Sequence diagrams, JSON schemas, MCP operations
- **Sprint_1_Context_Note.md:** Business context, technical requirements, success criteria

### 3. **Technical Decisions Finalized**
- **Data schemas:** Simplified KISS approach with JSON formats for all inter-module communication
- **Architecture stack:** Agent SDK + MCP protocol + Response API + LangSmith integration
- **Error handling:** Simple fallback strategies and graceful degradation
- **Testing approach:** Progressive weekly milestones with concrete acceptance criteria

## üîç Your Review Focus Areas

### For **Codex** (Content Generation Workflow)

#### Your Assigned User Stories:
- **#49** US-003: Research Team Knowledge Integration (P0, Week 1)
- **#50** US-011: Response API File_Search Integration Pattern (P1, Week 2)  
- **#51** US-004: Response API Content Synthesis (P1, Week 2)
- **#57** US-009: End-to-End CLI Integration (P3, Week 4) - Shared
- **#58** US-010: Example Syllabus Validation (P3, Week 4) - Shared

#### Key Review Questions:
1. **US-003 Research Team:** Is the `ResearchTeam.research_topic(syllabus_section)` interface clear? Do you understand the MCP Knowledge Bridge integration requirements?

2. **US-011 Response API Example:** Are the requirements for the file_search example clear? Do you have sufficient information about the OpenAI project setup (`proj_UWuOPp9MOKrOCtZABSCTY4Um`)?

3. **US-004 Content Synthesis:** Is the multi-step synthesis approach (syllabus+agenda+research notes) technically feasible? Are the integration points with File Operations MCP clear?

4. **Data Flow:** Review the sequence diagram in `Inter_Module_Architecture.md` - does the Research Team ‚Üí Editing Team workflow make sense?

5. **Dependencies:** US-003 blocks US-004. Is this dependency relationship manageable for your sprint timeline?

#### Technical Implementation Clarity:
- **Agent SDK usage:** Clear on how to implement multi-agent coordination?
- **MCP protocol:** Understand how to interact with Knowledge Bridge and File Operations MCP servers?
- **Response API integration:** Sufficient detail for file_search implementation?
- **JSON schemas:** Are the simplified schemas (ResearchNotes, ChapterDraft) actionable?

### For **Cursor** (Evaluation & Quality Systems)

#### Your Assigned User Stories:
- **#52** US-005: Editorial Finalizer Misconduct Tracking (P1, Week 2)
- **#54** US-012: LangSmith Post-Execution Metadata Integration (P1, Week 2)
- **#55** US-007: LangSmith Evaluation Logging (P2, Week 3)
- **#56** US-008: RAG Triad Knowledge Evaluation - Context Relevance (P2, Week 3)
- **#57** US-009: End-to-End CLI Integration (P3, Week 4) - Shared
- **#58** US-010: Example Syllabus Validation (P3, Week 4) - Shared

#### Key Review Questions:
1. **US-005 Misconduct Categories:** Are the defined misconduct categories (Critical: Content/Syllabus alignment, Inadequate level; High: Duration, Groundedness, Training principles; Medium: Repetition) specific enough for implementation?

2. **US-012 LangSmith Integration:** Is the Agent SDK built-in tracing approach clear? Do you understand the "story-ops" project setup and automatic metadata collection requirements?

3. **US-007 Evaluation Logging:** Clear on the difference between US-007 (conversation logging) and US-012 (metadata integration)?

4. **US-008 RAG Evaluation:** Is the simplified scope (Context Relevance only) sufficient for Sprint 1? Are you comfortable with the LLM-as-judge approach?

5. **Timeline Adjustment:** US-012 was moved from Week 3 to Week 2. Is this workload distribution manageable?

#### Technical Implementation Clarity:
- **LangSmith setup:** Clear on "story-ops" project configuration and kebab-case naming?
- **Agent SDK tracing:** Understand the built-in tracing capabilities vs custom implementation?
- **Quality assessment:** Clear on how to implement misconduct detection algorithms?
- **MCP file access:** Understand how to read quality data via File Operations MCP?

## üìù Review Process

### Step 1: Individual Review (48 hours)
1. **Read your assigned user stories** thoroughly (#46-60 on GitHub)
2. **Review architecture documentation** (focus on your domain)
3. **Check technical dependencies** and integration points
4. **Identify any blockers or unclear requirements**

### Step 2: Create Consolidated Feedback
**DO NOT update GitHub issues directly.** Instead, create a single consolidated response with:

#### For Each Assigned User Story:
- ‚úÖ **Green Light:** "Clear and actionable, ready for implementation"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Questions:** Specific clarifications needed before Sprint 1 start
- üö´ **Blockers:** Critical issues that would prevent Sprint 1 execution

#### Overall Assessment:
- **Sprint 1 Readiness:** Ready to start / Need clarifications / Major concerns
- **Timeline Feasibility:** Can you deliver your user stories within the proposed weekly schedule?
- **Technical Risk Assessment:** Any high-risk technical dependencies or unknowns?

### Step 3: Consolidated Team Response
Create **one document per team member** (Codex_Sprint_1_Review.md, Cursor_Sprint_1_Review.md) with:

```markdown
# [Codex/Cursor] Sprint 1 Review Response

- **Missing technical information** needed for development decisions
- **Unrealistic timeline** for assigned user stories
- **Blocking dependencies** that create unmanageable coordination overhead
- **Technical risks** that could derail sprint execution

## üìÖ Timeline

- **Review Period:** 48 hours from this instruction
- **Feedback Submission:** Single consolidated document per team member
- **Resolution Meeting:** If needed, based on feedback received
- **Sprint 1 Kickoff:** Once all blockers are resolved

## üéØ Expected Outcomes

### Best Case: Green Light
All user stories clear, architecture understood, timeline feasible ‚Üí **Sprint 1 starts immediately**

### Clarification Needed
Specific questions identified ‚Üí **Quick resolution meeting** ‚Üí Sprint 1 starts

### Major Concerns
Fundamental issues with scope/approach ‚Üí **Sprint planning revision** ‚Üí Updated plan ‚Üí Sprint 1 starts

## üìû Support Available

If you need clarification during your review:
- **Architecture questions:** Reference C4_Architecture_Mermaid.md and Inter_Module_Architecture.md
- **Technical details:** Check Sprint_1_Context_Note.md for implementation context
- **Business context:** Review the "Business Context & Vision" section
- **PBI decisions:** All responses documented in Consolidated_Sprint1_Questions.md

Remember: **This is your final opportunity to ensure Sprint 1 success.** Be thorough in your review and specific in your feedback. It's better to clarify requirements now than discover blockers mid-sprint.
