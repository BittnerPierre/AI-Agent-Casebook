# Training Course Narrative Guidelines

This document provides pedagogical guidelines and few-shot prompt templates to ensure consistent narrative style across all AI-generated training course content.

## Pedagogical Patterns

### 1. Learning Scaffolding
- **Objective:** Gradually build upon prior knowledge in logical steps.
- **Guidelines:**
  1. Introduce foundational concepts first.
  2. Provide clear links to previous lessons.
  3. Use brief recaps before advancing to new material.

### 2. Active Learning
- **Objective:** Encourage learner participation and reflection.
- **Guidelines:**
  1. Pose thought questions after each key concept.
  2. Include interactive prompts (e.g., "Consider how you would apply...").

### 3. Knowledge Anchoring
- **Objective:** Ground abstract concepts in real-world examples.
- **Guidelines:**
  1. Provide analogies or case studies.
  2. Reference previous training sessions when relevant.

### 4. Engagement Patterns
- **Objective:** Maintain learner interest and motivation.
- **Guidelines:**
  1. Alternate explanatory content with engaging scenarios.
  2. Use storytelling hooks to introduce new topics.

## Few-Shot Prompt Templates

Use these templates to guide AI agents when generating course materials.

### Prompt: Course Structure Outline
```
You are an AI teaching assistant. Given the following syllabus section:

Title: {{section_title}}
Description: {{section_description}}

Produce a structured outline with:
1) Learning objectives (3â€“5 bullets)
2) Key concepts to cover
3) Example activities or questions
```

### Prompt: Learning Objectives
```
Write 3â€“5 clear learning objectives for a lesson on "{{topic}}". Each should start with "Learners will be able to...".
```

### Prompt: Engagement Scenario
```
Create a brief real-world scenario that illustrates "{{key_concept}}" in context. Make it relatable and highlight why this concept matters.
```

## Adapting Video Script Patterns

Adapt elements from video_script guidelines:
- Use a conversational tone (see `app/video_script/script_guidelines.md`).
- Employ contextual hooks and narrative flow (see `app/video_script/storytelling_guidebook.md`).
- Replace conflict loops with knowledge loops: open a question, then resolve it with examples.

## Usage

At the start of each content generation phase, agents should load this guidelines document and apply the patterns above to structure chapter content consistently.
